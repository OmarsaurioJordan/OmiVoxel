# OmiVoxel

Voxel editor in Python, to create 2D art with ilumination, animation, 3D rotation

This is a project in develop, started in 2018, now it uses a command line (future GUI command). Another think is that in that years, I was starting with Python and no game engines develop, so I do this in one file!!! god kill me... now years next 2025 I see this and say okey, keep calm, this needs a cut in pieces, but for now I am in another projects :F

For now I dont say many here, but next I write the guide of use. Ok this repository is to save it for me (not yet for the end user)

I upload two versions of the main file, if you wanna test, the first is stable, te other is in develop so crash some functionalityes

This project uses Python, NumPy and PyGame (and other I dont remember). It has some images to show the results but it dont need other files than the main Python. So the software GUI and icon is made with the same software!

It uses handamade light raycasting to put shadows, so this software is some slow hahaha

License: This software is not ready for the general public yet, so you can see it, test it, but you can not show it at public, you can not earn money with it or use its art in your projects now. I any case, this software is mine and should has credits to me (maybe in future I go to free it for use only with credits to me). For now, think that it is secret XP
